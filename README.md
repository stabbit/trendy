![Trendy Demo](https://github.com/stabbit/trendy/blob/dev/assets/Dec-05-2023%2013-03-36.gif?raw=true)

## Installation
```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm run dev
```

Creating a `.env` file in the trendy root directory containing personal API keys will be necessary to have the website work.
Insert the following text and replace **APIKEYHERE** with the respective key.

* [Obtain a Yelp API Fusion key](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-authentication) (https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-authentication)
* [Obtain a Ninja key for the Sentiment API](https://api-ninjas.com/) (https://api-ninjas.com/)
```
YELP_API=APIKEYHERE
NINJA_API=APIKEYHERE
```

## Database
An SQL database is NOT required, but, if youâ€™re interested in the saving capabilities you will need to set one up. After obtaining the connection URI for the database, paste the string into the quotes on line 3 of the database.js file.
